> Please use the below questions to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- My experience was great!
- This testing assignment felt nicely practical and gave me a nice feel to what manual software testing could really look like.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
- I basically ran trough the test case first and during that marked waht variables I would like to use
- After that I ran trough the test case again, this time adding every required step with variables to the test case.
    
## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management
 - I'm not familiar with other tools and I was verry pleased with the ones provided
 - Simple .txt and md files are perfect to use alogn side with git
 - This makes changing the files and keeping log of those changes verry easy and secure

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code to edit the files
- It was easy to use with autfill and syntax highlighting also making the editing easy

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- Only trouble was to figure out when to add more variables or not
- Teachers counseling and logical thinking helped me with this challenge

## 6. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other)
- I have heard about Selenium before and visited their website
- It is for automating testing for web applications so I think it would be a good fit for a similiar task

## 7. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Ability to write relevant, actionable and reproducible bug reports and test cases that stand up to scrutiny
- Fluent in finnish and english
- testing experience is a plus
- knowledge of test techniques and programming
- Good organizational skills and a detail-oriented mindset

## 8. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Getting provable testing testing knowledge (the ISTQB certification for example)
- Posting own programming projects to GitHub with automated tests
- Enhance my english speaking skills

## 9. Are you going to apply for ISTQB Foundation level Certification?
- IT would be verry rewarding to get a certification, but I will still have to think about this.
- If software testing becomes the job in want to do in the future, then I definetily will apply for the certification.
